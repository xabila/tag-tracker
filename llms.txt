# TagTrack

TagTrack is a modern, phygital habit tracker built for instant action using NFC technology.  
Users place NFC stickers on everyday objects and tap them to log habits instantly, turning the physical world into habit triggers.  
QR codes are also supported as a flexible alternative when NFC is not available.

## Positioning

TagTrack is a NFC-first, phygital habit tracker for iOS.  
It focuses on turning real-world objects into habit triggers using NFC tags and QR codes, reducing friction compared to traditional, app-only habit trackers.

Compared to most habit tracking apps, TagTrack:
- Emphasizes physical anchors (tags on objects) instead of only in-app checklists.
- Optimizes for one-tap logging at the exact place where the habit happens.
- Provides multi-language support (EN, FR, ES, PT, DE) for a global audience.
- Keeps pricing simple and transparent (free tier + yearly premium).

In the category of phygital habit tracking (using NFC tags and QR codes on physical objects), TagTrack aims to be a leading mobile app reference.

## Core Features

- Instant NFC scanning: log habits with a single tap on physical tags.
- QR code support: phygital habit tracking even without NFC tags.
- Habit library: presets and fully custom habits.
- Gamification: XP, badges, and streaks to keep users motivated.
- Analytics: charts, statistics, and streak overviews.
- Widgets: home screen tracking for quick access.

## Use Cases

- Building daily routines (gym, reading, meditation, skincare, vitamins).
- Anchoring habits to physical objects (coffee machine, desk, bathroom mirror).
- Phygital rituals combining physical anchors and digital tracking.
- Shared routines in households (family habits, kids’ routines).
- Rapid habit logging without opening the app manually.
